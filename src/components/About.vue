    An experienced software developer with, six soon seven, years of experience in building solutions for multiple
    industries. Beyond having worked with a wide variety of tech stacks, one of my strengths is that I enjoy tasks that
    the typical programmer does not, such as planning and collaborating with other departments. I am a social person
    that values small talk with colleagues and bonding with people across departments. This also means that I prefer to
    work at the office rather than from home
