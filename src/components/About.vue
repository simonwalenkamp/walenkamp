        An experienced software developer with, six soon seven, years of experience in building solutions for multiple
        industries. Beyond having worked with a wide variety of tech stacks, one of my strengths is that I enjoy tasks
        that
        the typical programmer does not, such as planning and collaborating with other departments. I am a social person
        that values small talk with colleagues and bonding with people across departments. This also means that I prefer
        to
        work at the office rather than from home
